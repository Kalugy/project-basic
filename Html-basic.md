HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content.

HTML is the World Wide Web's core markup language. Originally, HTML was primarily designed as a language for semantically describing 
scientific documents. Its general design, however, has enabled it to be adapted, over the subsequent years, to describe a number of other 
types of documents and even applications.
